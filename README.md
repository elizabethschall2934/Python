# Python
Part 1--PyBank folder
The purpose of this activity was to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. 
I was given a set of financial data composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses` (Resources folder).

The tasks were to create a Python script (mainBank.py) that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script needed to print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results (Analysis folder).

Part 2--PyPoll folder
The purpose of this activity was to help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
I was given a set of poll data composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate` (Resources folder). 

The tasks were to create a Python script (mainPoll.py) that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast

2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

4. The total number of votes each candidate won

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script needed to print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results (Analysis folder).
